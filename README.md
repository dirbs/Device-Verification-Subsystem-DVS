## Directory structure

This repository contains code for **DVS** part of the **DIRBS**. It contains

* ``app/`` -- The DVS core server app, to be used as DVS Web Server including apis and resources
* ``etc/`` -- Config files etc to be reside here
* ``mock/`` -- Sample data files etc which are used in app to be reside here
* ``tests/`` -- Unit test scripts and Data

## Prerequisites
In order to run a development environment, [Python 3.0+](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) and 
[Postgresql10](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1786/) we assume that these are installed.

We also assume that this repo is cloned from Github onto the local computer, it is assumed that 
all commands mentioned in this guide are run from root directory of the project and inside
```virtual environment```

On Windows, we assume that a Bash like shell is available (i.e Bash under Cygwin), with GNU make installed.

## Starting a dev environment
The easiest and quickest way to get started is to use local-only environment (i.e everything runs locally). To setup the local environment, follow the section below:

## Setting up local dev environment
For setting up a local dev environment we assume that the ```prerequisites``` are met already. To setup a local 
environment:
* Create database using Postgresql (Name and credentials should be same as in [config](tests/unittest_data/config.ini))
* Create virtual environment using **virtualenv** and activate it:
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv 
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Make sure the virtual environment is made using python3

* Replace sample configuration in config.ini to similar configuration in tests/unittest_data/config.ini

* Replace sample conditions in etc/conditions.yml to classification conditions configured in DIRBS core system

* Create /reports folder in root directory

* Run Database migrations using:

```bash
make install-db
```

This will automatically create and migrate database schemas and requirements.

* Compile multi language encoded files
```bash
pybabel compile -d app/translations
```

* Start DVS development server using:
```bash
make start-dev
```

* Start celery worker
```bash
make start-celery
```

* To run unit tests, run
```bash
$ make test
```

* To lint the code using pylint, simply run:

```bash
make lint
```
### Other useful commands

* To install a fresh database:

```bash
make install-db
```

* To Upgrade already installed database:

```bash
make upgrade-db
```
